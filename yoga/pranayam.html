            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-body-secondary">Prana + Ayama = Pranayama </h6>
            <p>The Sanskrit word “prana” refers to respiration. The word “ayama”, also of Sanskrit origin, refers to “control”. Pranayama refers to the regulation of breathing.
            The practice of pranayama is often combined with the practice of asanas today. The calm of mind required for maintaining an asana can be achieved through pranayama.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family:Bebas Neue ;">Why Pranayama!?</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Decreases stress</b>
            <p>In a <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2013 study</a> pranayama reduced perceived stress levels in healthy young adults. The researchers speculated that pranayama calms the nervous system, which improves your stress response.
           <br>Another <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2013 study</a> Source found similar benefits. Individuals who practiced pranayama experienced less anxiety before taking a test.</p>
        </li>
    <li>
         <b>Improves sleep quality</b>
          <p> In clinical studiesTrusted Source, a technique known as <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">Bhramari pranayama</a> was shown to slow down breathing and heart rate when practiced for 5 minutes. This may help calm your body for sleep.
        <br>   According to a <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019 study</a> , pranayama also improves sleep quality in people with obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, the study found that practicing pranayama decreased snoring and daytime sleepiness, suggesting benefits for better quality rest.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>Increases mindfulness</b>
          <p> For many of us, breathing is automatic. We do it without giving it much thought at all.
           <br> But during pranayama, you need to be aware of your breathing and how it feels. You also practice focusing on the present moment, instead of the past or future. This is known as <a href="#"style="text-decoration: none;"> mindfulness</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Reduces high blood pressure</b>
        <p>  <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">High Blood Pressure</a>, or hypertension, is when your blood pressure reaches an unhealthy level. It increases the risk for some potentially serious health conditions like heart disease and stroke.
         <br>  Stress is a major risk factor for high blood pressure. Pranayama can help minimize this risk by promoting relaxation.</p>  
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Improves lung function</b>
            <p>
              One, <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2019 study </a>determined that 6 weeks of practicing pranayama for 1 hour a day could have a significant effect on lung function. The practice improved multiple parameters of lung function, according to pulmonary test results.
            <br>  According to the authors of the study, pranayama may be a useful lung strengthening tool for many lung conditions, including:
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Enhances cognitive performance</b>
            <p>
           A  <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2013 study </a> found that 12 weeks of slow or fast pranayama improved executive function — which includes your working memory, cognitive flexibility, and reasoning skills.
           <br/>The study also found that pranayama has the ability to improve your perceived level of stress and your reaction time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reduces cigarette cravings</b>
            <p>
                There's evidence that yogic breathing, or pranayama, could decrease cravings in people who are trying to quit smoking.
            <br/> In a <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">2012 study</a>, just 10 minutes of yogic breathing caused a short-term reduction in cigarette cravings.
